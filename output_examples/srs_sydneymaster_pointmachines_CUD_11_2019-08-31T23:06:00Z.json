However, when the point control switched to motor and be thrown to normal, TC threw the point via ATS for 2 times. The point still lost detection in normal.\nAlstom performed further checking and asked TC to throw the point by Route Setting. The point detection in normal can be obtained.\nTo minimize the impact to train service, CC decided to keep CUD11 in normal position and use CUD DN platform for turnback in the rest of day.\n11:00 Train service resumed with turnback at CUD DN\n\u00a0Follow-up: Detail investigation on CUD11 would be performed in Engineering hour.1-2 hours is expected to resolve the point failure.\n; Root Cause: Low motor clutch slip current (5.8A) found.", "reset_baseline": 0, "reset_agan": 0, "gps_latitude": "150.908912", "gps_longitude": "-33.690675"}
